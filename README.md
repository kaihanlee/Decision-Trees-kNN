# Decision-Trees-kNN

main code is in code.ipynb

BankDataset.py contains the dataset loader class. 

1. Dataset Analysis
2. Build a Decision Tree model (with hyperparameter tuning)
3. Perform a hyperparameter tuning for k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm. 
4. Plot training and development accuracy curves for both algorithms.
